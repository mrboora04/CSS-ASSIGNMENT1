                <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                <p>One love, one heart<br>
                Let's get together and feel all right<br>
                Hear the children crying (One love)<br>
                Hear the children crying (One heart)<br>
                Sayin', "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right."<br>
                Sayin', "Let's get together and feel all right."<br>
                Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</p>

                <p>Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One love)<br>
                There is one question I'd really love to ask (One heart)<br>
                Is there a place for the hopeless sinner<br>
                Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own?<br>
                Believe me</p>

                Let's get together and feel all right<br>
                As it was in the beginning (One love)<br>
                So shall it be in the end (One heart)<br>
                Alright, "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right."<br>
                "Let's get together and feel all right."<br></p>
